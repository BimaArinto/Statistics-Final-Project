Probability and Statistics Project from Pacmann - Bima Arinto Nugroho - AI/ML Engineering

This would be my first analysis project using python and all of it's library for visualization and statistics. And because this is my first time, you will see bad coding, visualization, or even worse, you can't understand with what I'm doing here. But I really appreciate the your ideas and if you think I did something wrong and want me to change it, please contact me at bimaarinto@gmail.com
